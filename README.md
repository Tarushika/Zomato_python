Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Zomato's data using Python. I utilized Jupyter Notebook to explore and derive insights from various datasets, employing libraries like NumPy,pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to perform data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Used pandas to clean and preprocess the Zomato dataset, handling missing values and filtering relevant data for analysis.
Created dataframes to structure the dataset for easy manipulation and exploration.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Applied NumPy for basic numerical operations and statistics to understand distribution and key metrics.
Conducted EDA using pandas and seaborn, analyzing trends in restaurant ratings, price levels, and geographical locations.
Visualizations:

Utilized matplotlib and seaborn to create various charts, including bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to visualize:
Rating distributions
Price vs. rating analysis
Geographical restaurant spread
Created interactive visualizations to enhance data storytelling and make trends easier to identify.
Correlation Analysis:

Explored relationships between different features, such as how pricing correlates with restaurant ratings and how locations affect restaurant popularity.
4. Tools & Libraries:
NumPy for numerical analysis.
pandas for data manipulation and dataframes.
seaborn for statistical visualizations.
matplotlib for creating detailed plots and charts.
Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and visualization.
5. Challenges & Solutions:
Challenge: Handling missing and inconsistent data in the Zomato dataset.
Solution: Used pandas to clean and transform the dataset, ensuring that visualizations reflected accurate data.
 Impact:
The project provided insights into Zomato's data, uncovering key trends in customer preferences, pricing, and restaurant locations. It can be used by business stakeholders for market research, customer behavior analysis, and strategic decision-making.
